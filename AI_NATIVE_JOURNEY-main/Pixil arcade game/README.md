## ðŸ§  How It Works (Core Logic)

- **User Profiles**: Each player has a profile (name, score, coins, games played) stored in your browser's localStorage. You can switch users or create new ones anytime.
- **Game Sessions**: After each game, your score and coins are automatically added to your profile. Coin rewards are calculated based on the game and your performance.
- **Leaderboard**: The leaderboard is generated by sorting all profiles by score, with medals for the top 3 players.
- **Daily Challenges**: Track your progress toward daily goals and earn bonus coins.
- **Simulated Sessions**: On first load, the app creates sample users and scores to show how everything works.
- **Extensible Design**: The code is modular, so you can add new games or features easily.
